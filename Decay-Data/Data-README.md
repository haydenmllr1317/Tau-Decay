THIS FILE EXPLAIN EACH DATASET IN DECAY-DATA FOLDER
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_15GeVMass_JanIdea.root
Info:
This file has 4300+ events with the “upsilon” mass is set to 15 GeV. All the pions have been rotated into the desired frame and you can access that information via the toUse branches.
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_START_Upsilon_nomMass_Total_5May2020.root
Info:
This file has 2612 events with (we believe, given the title), nominal "upsilon" mass. Neutral pions in the decay have been excluded.
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_nomMass_total_JanIdea.root
Info:
This file has 1700+ events at seemingly nominal upsilon mass. Might contain vectors rotated into desired frame which would be labeled as "toUse".
