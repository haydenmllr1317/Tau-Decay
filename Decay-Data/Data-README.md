THIS FILE EXPLAIN EACH DATASET IN DECAY-DATA FOLDER
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_15GeVMass_JanIdea.root
Info:
This file has 4300+ events with the “upsilon” mass is set to 15 GeV. All the pions have been rotated into the desired frame and you can access that information via the toUse branches.
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_START_Upsilon_nomMass_Total_5May2020.root
Info:
This file has 2612 events with (we believe, given the title), nominal "upsilon" mass. Neutral pions in the decay have been excluded.
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_nomMass_total_JanIdea.root
Info:
This file has 1700+ events at seemingly nominal upsilon mass. Might contain vectors rotated into desired frame which would be labeled as "toUse".
//
Data Set File Name:
CUT_nomMass_from_Otto.root
Info:
This file has around 1000 nominal upsilon mass events. Might contain vectors rotated into desired frame which would be labeled as "toUse".
//
Data Set File Name:
cartesian_upsilon_taus_GENSIM_withBP_*.root, where * \in {1-10}
Info:
These are ten files that have 15Gev upsilons (and decay products), with no neutral pions.

Info:
This is a flat file with 15GeV upsilons with no neutral pions, it contains roughly 2600 events. I would check that this is different data from the other data with 2600 events. There is no evidence that they are similar, the numbers are just the same so worth checking.
